parse.line=Line {0}\: {2}
parse.prop={1} property\: {2}
parse.lineWithProp=Line {0} ({1} property)\: {2}

parse.0=Property has requested that it be skipped: {0}
parse.1=Property value could not be parsed.  Reason: {0}
#parse.16=Property could not be unmarshalled.  Unmarshalling as an XML property instead.  Reason: {0} #removed in 0.6.1-SNAPSHOT
#parse.2=Ignoring END property that does not match up with any BEGIN properties. #removed in 0.6.1-SNAPSHOT

parse.4=The following parameters are nameless: {0}
parse.5=Timezone ID "{0}" not recognized.  Parsing with default timezone "{1}" instead.
parse.23=Property value is empty.  One of the following XML elements are expected: {0}.
parse.31=Unable to decode quoted-printable value.  Treating as plain-text.  Reason: {0}
parse.32=The property''s character encoding ("{0}") is not supported by this system.  {1} will be used instead.
parse.37=No VTIMEZONE component exists with an ID of \"{0}\".  ID will be treated as an Olsen timezone ID instead.
parse.38=No VTIMEZONE component exists with an ID of \"{0}\".  ID could not be parsed as an Olsen timezone ID either.  The date will be parsed under the default timezone.
parse.39=VTIMEZONE component ignored: No TZID property defined.
parse.43=TZID \"{0}\" is formatted as an Olsen ID (begins with a forward slash), but no such Olsen ID exists.  Since the TZID matches that of a VTIMEZONE component, the property will use the timezone defined by the VTIMEZONE component.
